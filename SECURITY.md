## AI Chat Turn Hardening

The `POST /api/v1/agents/chat` endpoint includes mandatory runtime controls per request:

- **Authentication gate:** only authenticated sessions can open chat streams.
- **Rate limiting:** per-user/IP request windows reduce abuse and brute-force traffic.
- **Tool authorization:** requested tools are validated and mapped to RBAC permissions before use.
- **Correlation IDs:** each turn carries a request correlation identifier (`x-correlation-id`) for traceability.
- **Structured logging:** chat lifecycle events are logged as metadata-only records without prompt/response body data.
